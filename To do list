Functionality:

1. home page

Cognito -- usergroup, identity group
CORS 

2. chatbot
lex -- fill the indent

lambda function: return content like results of info from API or link of serach result.

(recognize link -- how to jump to page -- return back to chatpage)

click on some items to add them in the wish list! (IMPORTANT and need to be modified)
Possibly we can do a map display for spots and routes with Google API

use database to store user information


3. wish list/history
possibly use elasticsearch for better search of detailed arrangements or route in history.

past date routes in wish list transferred to history 

use sqs and lambda and sns to do sms notification.
notice here different from in assignment, user should be noticed on the arranged date (a week).

user should also be able to click on items in list to get detailed info by jump or search in db...




Need to do:

-- system design: function plot

-- task allocation


Inspiration:
TRY Google trips!
